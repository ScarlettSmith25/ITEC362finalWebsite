        <h2>McKissick Museum</h2>
        <p>
            John McKissick was the head football coach for the Summerville High School Greenwave from 1952 to 20154. McKissick brought much glory to the town of Summerville as he led the high school football team to 621 game wins throughout his career, giving him the title of most wins by a football coach at any level. He was a coach, a husband, and a father who was loved and well-cherished by all.

            The McKissick Museum was built beside the Summerville High School football stadium to honor the late head coach, John McKissick. It was truly a state effort to properly pay tribute to John McKissick and his family for all of the time and last impacts they have made on the community and generations to come.
